In addition, system will be dependent on the following constraints:
e Heavy processing will be done in limited time thus computer must have more than two CPU
cores to handle concurrent processing better.
e Image quality is very important. Lighting of the area, concentrated dust on the car plate, and

air effects like fog might reduce precision

System should work on a general computer. It will not contain any hardware designed for image

processing. Implementation will be done taking this constraint into account.

3. Specific Requirements

3.1. Interface Requirements

The primary input to the system is the image acquired from the device, i.e. camera. After object
recognition and object tracking phases, this image is used in augmented reality phase with the
resultant information. Eventually, the watcher can see enhanced view of the area on the screen.

System also is open to user input in terms of mouse clicks and/or keyboard. The watcher must be
able to click onto a car to see additional information such as profile of the driver if he/she is an
employee.

The watcher will also be able to save a special frame with a mouse click.

The records of each cars entrance and exit times are kept in the database, user can access this
information any time he wants by providing plate number. This information will be shown in another
window as a list.

User can change basic settings of the software like color of border augmentation.

As explained in Section 2.1, the system consists of mainly three components. They are camera,
processing unit and screen. Since processing unit and screen will be on the same machine, the interface

between them will be straightforward. Camera will be connected to that machine (laptop).
