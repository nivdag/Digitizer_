Iterative and incremental development model is going to be used by the team

7. Conclusion

We have given information about the software requirements specification of Car Tracker
project. The project aims to help security officers in an auto park by enhancing the view on
their screens. Since the project is mainly about algorithms and implementation, usage of the
system is a little bit straightforward. Therefore as the readers have noticed, this document
has been laconic. Nevertheless, we believe this software will be very helpful for security

officers in action.
