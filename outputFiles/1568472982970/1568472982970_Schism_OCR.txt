3) System user/watcher can click inside any of the recognized cars’ borders to view car
speed, model, color, chassis, motor size, fuel type, employee ID, first name, last name,
department and other information if present (‘other’ is detailed in section 4).

4) System user/watcher can save a frame from the video stream.

3.3. Non-functional Requirements
There are two major goals relevant to the implementation. These are performance
and accuracy of the system.
3.3.1. Performance
Performance is one of the two major issues for our system. The system should have a
high performance such that the user should be able to see a the augmented view of the area
streaming with 25 fps.
3.3.2. Accuracy
Accuracy of the system is important for the user. For this reason, under the given
assumptions in Section 3.1, the system should have 100% accuracy, meaning that it should
recognize all cars correctly.
3.3.3. Simplicity
Regarding user interface, an important design goal is keeping it simple. User interface
should not be so complicated. Besides, the user should not need to do anything for basic
usage of the system, that is seeing the speed of cars and seeing whether a car is owned by
an employee or a visitor.
3.3.4. Security
Since the system will be used offline and by a single user, security is not an issue.
3.3.5. Availability
System will be available as long as the computer is running on is available.
3.3.6. Maintainability
Our system is specified for one task. There will not be so much change in the future.

Therefore, maintainability does not have more importance than it has in a normal software.
