In the case of detecting cars in the area, the system will try to do two things; first being

recognizing the cars and second being the tracking. At the same time when it creates enough

information from the context, it will reflect this information to the screen for watchers, e.g.

security officer. If there is no car in the view, system will not show any information to

watcher.
